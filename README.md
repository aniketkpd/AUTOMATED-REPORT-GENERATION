**DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT**

This project reads a dataset about phone usage in India, analyzes it, and creates a detailed PDF report using Python. The dataset includes information such as screen time (hours/day), data usage (GB/month), and monthly recharge costs (INR). The project demonstrates how to process datasets, generate summaries, and present results in a professional PDF format.

The analysis includes:

A sample of the dataset for quick understanding.
Statistical analysis like count, mean, and standard deviation, rounded to two decimal places for clarity.
The PDF report is created using the FPDF library. It contains:

A title indicating the purpose of the report.
A sample view of the dataset displayed in a neat table format.
Statistical analysis of the dataset, including key metrics for each column, presented in a structured table.
An explanation of the dataset variables (e.g., ST, DU, MRC) for clarity.
The report is generated programmatically, ensuring consistent formatting and presentation.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python: The main programming language for the project.
Pandas: To process and analyze the dataset.
FPDF: To create the PDF report.
Output:
The final output is a PDF document named "Report.pdf" that includes:

A title page with the project name.
A preview of the dataset as a table.
Statistical insights (mean, count, etc.) for quick analysis.
An explanation of the dataset's key variables.
This project showcases how to analyze a dataset and generate an automated, well-formatted report using Python.
